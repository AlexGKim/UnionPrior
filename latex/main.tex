\maketitle

The DESI plus SN results have folks in a flurry.  Talking with DESI and David it is clear that DESI is incorporating Union3
into their analyses incorrectly.  They take Union3 results as data, interpret the covariance matrix as a Gaussian uncertainty,
and include them in a larger likelihood.  The Unity ``Binned'' model distance modulus
is the sum of distance modulus for $\Lambda$CDM with $\Omega_M=0.3$ and a second-order spline defined be nodes $n$ at set of redshift values $z$.  The nodes have a uniform prior.  David provides the posterior of the parameters as
$\mu_{\Lambda CDM}(z) + n$ and the  Hessian of the $n$ posterior.  It is of interest to explore how misapplication
of Union3 could affect DESI fits.

DESI uses the posterior to fit a $w_0$--$w_a$ cosmology model, which is not a subset of the Unity ``Binned'' model.  Nevertheless,
the ``Binned'' model can come close by fixing the values at the modes to match those of the $w_0$--$w_a$  model and swallowing the
inconsistencies between the physics and spline values between the nodes.  Conversely, a large volume of the ``Binned'' model
has no $w_0$--$w_a$ cosmology correspondence.

The objective is to see how the ``Binned'' prior maps onto $w_0$--$w_a$.  This is acc
