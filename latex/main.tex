\maketitle

The DESI plus SN results have folks in a flurry.  Talking with DESI and David it is clear that DESI is incorporating Union3
into their analyses incorrectly albeit in a subtle way;  it is of interest to explore how misapplication
of Union3 could affect  DESI $w_0$--$w_a$  fits.

In the Unity ``Binned'' model, the distance modulus model function
is the sum of the distance modulus for $\Omega_M=0.3$  $\Lambda$CDM plus a second-order spline specified by node values
at a fixed set of redshifts.  The results of the fit are provided by David as as
$\mu_{\Lambda \text{CDM}}(z;\Omega_M=0.3) + n$ and the  Hessian of the $n$ posterior,
where $z$ are the fixed redshifts and $n$ the node-value parameters.
DESI take the Union ``Binned"-model parameter posterior output as data, interpret the covariance matrix as a Gaussian uncertainty,
and include them in a larger likelihood. 

DESI uses the posterior to fit a $w_0$--$w_a$ cosmology model, which is not embedded in the Unity ``Binned'' model.  Nevertheless,
the ``Binned'' model can come close by fixing the values at the modes to match those of the $w_0$--$w_a$  model and swallowing the
inconsistencies between the physics and spline values between the nodes.  For the purposes of this work, I consider
as the  $w_0$--$w_a$ model  the subspace
of the ``Binned'' model that have $\mu$ values at the nodes in the space  covered by the true $w_0$--$w_a$
model.  The transformation between $\theta=\{\Omega_M, w_0, w_a\}$ and $n$ is given by
\begin{align}
	n_i &= f(\Omega_M, w_0, w_a; z_i) \\
	& \equiv \mu_{w_0 w_a \text{CDM}}(z_i;\Omega_M, w_0, w_a)  - \mu_{\Lambda \text{CDM}}(z_i;\Omega_M=0.3) 
\end{align}

The prior used in the Union3 analysis is inconsistent with that used by DESI.  Union3 takes a uniform prior for its node values whereas
DESI takes a uniform prior in $\Omega_M$--$w_0$--$w_a$ space.  The Union3 flat prior
on $n$  corresponds to a $\theta=\{\Omega_M, w_0, w_a\}$ prior
\begin{equation}
p(\Omega_M, w_0,w_a) \propto \sqrt{\det{\left(J^T J\right)}},
\end{equation}
where $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of $f$
and $J^TJ$ is the Gram matrix.

The Union3 prior  (up to a normalization factor)  in $w_0$--$w_a$  for a grid of values of $\Omega_M$
given the flat node-value prior is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:priors}. 
The prior favors small $w_0$ and large $w_a$.  $\Lambda$CDM lies in a disfavored region.
